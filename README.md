# The Wall is Down: 1989-2014
1989. Cold war is over. The Berlin wall is down. URSS breaks into pieces and USA
becomes the global superpower. However, the world is not totally polarized. New
powers acquire nuclear weapons: France, UK, Israel, India, Pakistan. China adopts a
more active role. Russia is still a relevant factor and Europe joins into a common
but hard to coordinate agenda.
25 years since the wall fell, the cold war has become global, muti-modal, and
more complex than ever.

The Wall is Down is a 1-4 player game of geopolitics inspired in Twilight Struggle.
* bundle has all the components you need to play the game: rules, board, cards and tokens. Just print them and use some color cubes and a 6-sided dice.
* bunbleRW has the original files if you want to translate, change or improve the game.
